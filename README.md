## Installation

### 1. Require the package

   ```bash
   composer require whilesmart/eloquent-model-configuration
   ```

### 2. Publish the configuration and migrations:

You do not need to publish the migrations and configurations except if you want to make modifications. You can choose to
publish
the migrations, routes, controllers separately or all at once.

#### 2.1 Publishing only the routes

Run the command below to publish only the routes.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=model-configuration-routes
php artisan migrate
```

The routes will be available at `routes/model-configuration.php`. You should `require` this file in your `api.php` file.

```php
    require 'model-configuration.php';
```

#### 2.2 Publishing only the migrations

+If you would like to make changes to the migration files, run the command below to publish only the migrations.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=model-configuration-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

The migrations will be available in the `database/migrations` folder.

#### 2.3 Publish only the controllers

By default the controllers assign the device to the currently logged in user. If you would like to assign the device to
another model, you can publish the controllers and make the necessary changes to the published file. <br/>
To publish the controllers, run the command below

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=model-configuration-controllers
php artisan migrate
```

The controllers will be available in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory.
Finally, change the namespace in the published controllers to your namespace.


#### 2.4 Publish the documentation

To publish the openapi documentation, run the command below

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=model-configuration-docs
```
The documentation will be available at `app/Http/Documentation`

#### 2.5 Publish everything

To publish the migrations, routes and controllers, you can run the command below

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=model-configuration
php artisan migrate
```

#### Note: See section 2.1 above to make the routes accessible

#### 2.6 Middleware configuration
The default controller gets the authenticated user from the `Request` object. The default routes must be placed in an auth middleware. Set your auth middleware in the `config/model-configuration.php` file.
```php
<?php

return [
    ...,
    'auth_middleware' => ['auth:sanctum'],
];

```

#### 2.7 More configurations
Config keys are case-insensitive by default. For example `ConfigName` and `configname` are considered the same. To change this behavior, set the `allow_case_insensitive_keys` config variable to `true`.
```php
<?php

return [
    ...,
    'allow_case_insensitive_keys' => true,
];
```

Config names can take only the following:
1. Lowercase characters: a to z
2. Uppercase characters: A to Z
3. Numbers: 0 to 9
4. Some special characters:  hyphen (-), underscore (_), fullstop (.) and plus (+)

You can also restrict the key names allowed by adding each allowed key name in the `allowed_keys` array
```php
<?php

return [
    ...,
    'allowed_keys' => ['key-1','key-2'],
];
```

### 3. Model Relationships

We have implemented a Trait `Configurable` that handles relationships. If your model has configuration, simply use the
`Configurable` trait in your model definition.

```php
use Whilesmart\ModelConfiguration\Traits\Configurable
class MyModel {
 use Configurable;
}
 
```

You can call `yourModel->configurations()` to get the list of configuration tied to the model

```php
$model = new MyModel();
$model->configurations();
```

The `Configurable` trait also has the `getConfigurationssAttribute()` method. If you want to append the configuration to the model response, simply add `configuration` to your model's $appends

```php
use Whilesmart\ModelConfiguration\Traits\Configurable;
class MyModel {
 use Configurable;
 
 protected $appends = ['configurations'];
}

```

The following additional methods are available also available in the `Configurable` trait
1. `getConfig()` gets the full details of a particular config. It returns a `Configuration` object
```php

$model = new MyModel();
$config = $model->getConfig('default_wallet');
$config_id = $config->id;
```
2. `getConfigValue()` gets the value of a particular config. It also ensures the value is returned in the correct type
```php

$model = new MyModel();
$config_value = $model->getConfigValue('default_wallet');
```

3. `getConfigType()` gets the type of a particular config. It returns a `ConfigValueType` enum
```php

$model = new  MyModel();
$config_type = $model->getConfigType('default_wallet');
```
4. `setConfigValue()` sets/updates the value of a particular config. It returns a `Configuration` object
```php

$model = new MyModel();
$config= $model->setConfigValue('default_wallet',1, ConfigValueType::Integer);
```

## Usage

After installation, the following API endpoints will be available:

* **POST /api/configurations:** Registers a new config linked to the current logged in user.
* **GET /api/configurations:** Retrieves all configurations linked to the current logged in user.
* **PUT /api/configurations/{id}:** Updates the information in a configuration.
* **DELETE /api/configurations/{id}:** Deletes a configuration.
* **OpenAPI Documentation:** Accessible via a route that your OpenAPI package defines.

**Example  Request:**

```json
{
  "value":"unique_token_string",
  "type":"string"
}
